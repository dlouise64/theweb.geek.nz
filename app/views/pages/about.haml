        %h1.intro__heading Hello, I'm Dana
        %p
          I am a Web Developer from Lower Hutt working in Wellington city. I have been coding since I was a child, no kidding. I am literally a geek.
        %p
          I built a web application to track my store inventory when I was a stay at home mum back in 2007. I actually ended my clothing design business to continue my love for coding and I have never looked back.

        %p
          I've been through many avenues in my career, first starting off as a front-end developer / web designer, then onto back-end for many years.
        %p
          I have taught Web Development in schools, namely Yoobee School of Design and Wellington High School. Teaching is a very fulfilling profession, especially when you see students eyes open for the first time.

        %p
          I am always on the look-out for new and exciting opportunities,
