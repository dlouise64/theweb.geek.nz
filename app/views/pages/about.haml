        %h1.intro__heading Hello, I'm Dana
        %p.intro__text
          I am a born and bred Kiwi Web Developer from Lower Hutt currently working in Wellington city. I have been coding since I was a child, no kidding. I am literally a geek. 
        %p.intro__text
          I built a web application to track my store inventory when I was a stay at home mum back in 2007. I actually ended my clothing design business to continue my love for coding and I have never looked back.

        %p.intro__text
          I've been through many avenues in my career, first starting off as a front-end developer / web designer, then onto back-end for many years.
        %p.intro__text
          I have taught Web Development in schools, namely Yoobee School of Design and Wellington High School. Teaching is a very fulfilling profession, especially when you see students eyes open for the first time.
          There is also no better feeling when you hear about your students landing a Web Development job.
        %p.intro__text
          Recently, I decided to become specialised in front-end development as it's what I enjoy doing the most and frankly it's where my strengths are.
          That's not to say I never code in back-end anymore, I still do at home; mostly for fun.

        %p.intro__text
